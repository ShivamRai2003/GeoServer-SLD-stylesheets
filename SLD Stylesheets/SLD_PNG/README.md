### Choropleth_Maps : 
Achoropleth map is a thematic map where geographic regions are colored, shaded, or patterned in relation to a value.

**Aim** : This type of map is particularly useful when visualizing a variable and how it changes across defined regions or geopolitical areas.
A choropleth map is extremely useful when looking at vote totals by political party per county in the United States. 

In a choropleth map, color can be used to represent distinct attributes or, as in the example below, to represent weight of a value (a strong or weak party vote-share shown as light or dark colors).

### Heats Maps : 
 A heat map represents the intensity of an incidentâ€™s occurrence within a dataset. A heatmap uses color to represent intensity, though unlike a choropleth map, a heatmap does not use geographical or geo-political boundaries to group data.

**Aim** : Visualizing the intensity of occurrence using a heat map is a technique commonly used when tracking weather and natural phenomena, in which established borders and boundaries are less useful for understanding impact areas.

### Proportional symbol maps : 
A proportional symbol map can represent data tied to a specific geographical point or data that is aggregated to a point from a wider area.In these maps, a symbol is used to represent the data at that specific or aggregate point, and then scaled by value, so that a larger symbol represents a greater value.

**Aim** :  It is used for comparison and classification of locations.

### Lines Maps : 
For lines maps the emphasis is the quantitative or qualitative information about the transported or moved object.

**Aim** : Allows to visualised how much of something can be transported in which time or speed on what way and in which direction by means of lines and vectors. It gives us a detailed elevation
